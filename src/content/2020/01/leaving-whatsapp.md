WHAAT?

Undoubtfully – it’s a very handy tool. More than 1.5 billion people use it. Free cross-platform messaging, free group chat, free calls, free video calls. This was (and is) game-changing. Revolutionary 10 years ago!

*I bought WhatsApp for €0.79 in 2010*

Extremely impressive backend technology, written in Erlang. In 2015 WhatsApp had only 50 engineers handling 900M users. That was roughly one year after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19BN. I honestly admired the team as I know what it means to build a messaging service for millions of users.

## Wait. $19BN for a free service?

WhatsApp is Facebooks second biggest property. Facebook is making money with the data for their users – **YOUR DATA**.

The price is too high. Your messages, your messaging metadata, your friends, your connections,…  
Guess why the WhatsApp Founder Brian Acton left Facebook 2018 – 4 years after the acquisition and left $850M on the table?

## The tipping point

> The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman *(Saudi crown prince)* is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the world’s richest man, according to the results of a digital forensic analysis.

*The Guardian (January 2020): [Jeff Bezos phone got hacked via WhatsApp](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince).*

Jeff Bezos got a video message. That video message infiltrated the phone, and the hackers could get access to all content on this phone.

- messages
- photos
- call history
- location (history)
- contacts
- …

But wait – you’ve also voluntarly granted these permissions to WhatsApp. Are you sure you trust Facebook?

**Privacy comes at a price**. I’m willing to pay the price. Even if Billions of users act otherwise and take part in that game.

## Becoming Facebook free

This is the logical next step on my journey to become Facebook (the company) free. [After deleting my Facebook account](facebook-the-end) I’m now deleting my Whatsapp account. I’ve requested my data, it’s ready today.

You can request your data under *Settings -> Account -> Request Account Info*

Instagram is next.

*I encourage you to do the same. It feels great and will feel great in future.*

**Updates:**

_February, 8th 2026:_ As you might have noticed, I returned to Whatsapp a while ago. It was simply unavoidable. Still, I'm using Signal wherever possible and reduce Whatsapp usage to a minimum. I haven't returned to Facebook or <strikethrough>Twitter</strikethrough> X and I will never return.
